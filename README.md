Hello, this is MSH9, with a proper first website. I want to learn how to code properly, so this is a good start for me personally. 

Here, I will build a basic recipe website using skills i have been building from the Odin Project. It will contain Lists of ingredients for various dishes, and while very basic, is a stepping stone.
